"""

This script should handle the actual act of moving
our player. We can reference/check against the 
current InputManager values, and use those to call
the translation and rotation functions that will
exist within this script.

Tip: You can have an int that defines what style
movement we're moving with (walk, run, sprint, whatever)
and then the PlayerStatus script can use this info
to automatically increase or decrease the players stamina
